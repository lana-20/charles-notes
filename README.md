- <code>Structure</code> tab groups HTTP requests by host.
- <code>Sequence</code> tab shows each HTTP request individually sorted by oldest first.

## Structure Tab Icons

Each host on the Structure tab has one of these four icons (the icons in the program are tiny, hence the  low-res image quality)

📋 To summarize: lock 🔒 icon means SSL proxying is not enabled for that HTTPS host; lightning ⚡️ in the icon means the host is using HTTP/2 protocol.
